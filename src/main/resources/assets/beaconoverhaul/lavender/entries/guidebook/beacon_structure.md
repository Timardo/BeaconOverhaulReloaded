To activate the %{block.minecraft.beacon}% and gain its potent effects,
you must construct a pyramid underneath it out of expensive materials such as %{block.minecraft.iron_block}%,
%{block.minecraft.gold_block}%, or %{block.minecraft.diamond_block}%.


The beacon must not have any non-transparent blocks above it, in order to activate.

;;;;;

Beacons have multiple tiers:

The higher the tier, the more effects you gain access to.
Constructing a larger beacon has the additional benefit of making your effects more powerful,
through longer durations, higher effect levels, and a larger range.
