To activate the %{block.minecraft.beacon}% and gain its potent effects,
you must construct a pyramid underneath it out of expensive materials such as
%{block.minecraft.iron_block}%, %{block.minecraft.gold_block}%, or %{block.minecraft.diamond_block}%.


The beacon must not have any non-transparent blocks above it, in order to activate.
